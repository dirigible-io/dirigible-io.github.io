This sample shows how to enable the Role Based Access Management for the Content Management System in Eclipse Dirigible.

### Steps

1. Set the environment variable:
	
	export DIRIGIBLE_CMS_ROLES_ENABLED=true

	-DDIRIGIBLE_CMS_ROLES_ENABLED=true

2. Open Dirigible WebIDE and go to Documents perspective
3. Create sub-folder "private" under the "root" folder
4. Create sub-folder "shared" under the "root" folder 
5. Upload a text file named "secret.txt" under the "private" folder with the following content

```
This is a top secret information accessible only by users with the role Operator!
```

6. Upload a text file named "billboard.txt" under the "shared" folder with the following content

```
This is a public notice accessible by Everyone.
```

7. Click on Preview icon next to the files. You should be able to see the content of both of them.

8. Open the Workspace perspective in the WebIDE
9. Create a project named "cms_permissions"
10. Create an *.access file via the popup menu New->Access Constraints
11. Open the file with editor 
12. Delete the sample record
13. Click New button
14. Fill the form as follows:

```
Path: /private
Method: READ
Scope: CMIS
Roles: Operator
```

15. Click Save button
16. The content of the file should look like: 

```
{
  "constraints": [
    {
      "path": "/private",
      "method": "READ",
      "scope": "CMIS",
      "roles": [
        "Operator"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: You can inspect that be closing the editor and then use Open With from the popup menu on the same file, but choosing Orion editor option

17. Publish the project manually via the popup menu on the project level (in case the Auto-Publish is disabled)

20. Open the Preview of the file secret:

	http://localhost:8080/services/v3/js/ide-documents/api/read/document/preview?path=/private/secret.txt
	
21. Only the users who has the role Operator should be able to see the content of the file
