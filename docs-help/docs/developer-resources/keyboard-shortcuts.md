Keyboard Shortcuts
===

Keyboard shortcuts represent combinations of two or more keyboard buttons that, when pressed at the same time, yield actions that can also be achieved by clicking a button on the UI.


|      Keyboard Combination   | Action |
| ------------- |-------------|
| ++f1++                                   | Command Pallette |
| ++ctrl+s++  / ++command+s++              | Save |
| ++ctrl+shift+i++  /  ++command+shift+i++ | Format the document |
| ++ctrl+shift+f++  /  ++command+shift+f++ | Open **Search** popup |


## Command Pallette

The command pallette gives you access to the most common operations in the default editor along with their keyboard shortcuts.
