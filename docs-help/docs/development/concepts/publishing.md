Publishing
===

There is a conceptual separation between `design-time` and `runtime` phases of the development life cycle.

During the `design-time` phase, the source artifacts are created and managed within the isolated developer's area - [workspace](../workspace/).
When you are ready with a given feature, you have to `publish` the project so that the application artifacts become available for the other users. 

The meaning of _"available"_ depends on the type of artifact. For example, for `JavaScript services` this is the registration of a public endpoint, while for `web` and `wiki` content, it is just the access to the artifacts them self, etc.

Publishing action is accessible from the context menu in the `Workspace` view.

The space within the `repository`, where all the public artifact are placed, is called `registry`.
