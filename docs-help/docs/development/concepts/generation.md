Generation
===

Template-based generation of artifacts helps for developer productivity in the initial phase of building the application. There are several application components that have similar behavior and often very similar implementation. 

A prominent example is [entity service](../entity-service/). It has several predefined methods based on [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) concepts and [HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` on an entity level as well as a list of all entities. Additionally, the most notable storage for the entity data is the RDBMS provided by the platform.

Another example are user interface templates based on patterns - `list`, `master-detail`, `input form`, etc. 
Templates can also be provided based on different frameworks for client-side interaction.

> _**Note:** The generation here is a one-time process. Once you have the generated artifact, you can modify it based on your own requirements._

In contrast to the approach above, in case of [MDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture), 
you can expect to regenerate the [PSMs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform-specific_model) every time you make changes on [PIMs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform-independent_model). For this approach, we introduced the [entity data modeler](../../ide/modelers/entity-data) where you can define declaratively all the needed components and their attributes. Afterwards, you can use them to generate a complete full-stack data-driven application.

> _**Note:** The enhancements in this case must go via [extensions](../extensions/) only._
