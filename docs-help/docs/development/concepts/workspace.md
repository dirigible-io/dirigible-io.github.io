Workspace
===

The `workspace` is the developer's place where you create and manage the application artifacts. The first-level citizens of the `workspace` are the `projects`. Each project can contain multiple folders and files (artifacts).

A single user can have multiple workspaces that contain different sets of projects.

The artifacts, i.e. the project management, can be done via the views and editors in the [`Workbench` perspective](../../ide/perspectives/workbench/).
