Repository
===

The repository component is the main place where all the project's artifacts are stored. It provides an abstract "file-system-like" structure with folder and files that can be backed by different underlying persistence storages - file system, relational database, noSQL database, etc.

In a single repository instance there are several spaces holding different types of content - users' workspaces, public [registry](../registry/), search indices, git metadata, versions, etc.
