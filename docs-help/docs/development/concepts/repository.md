Repository
===

The `repository` component is the main place where all the project's artifacts are stored. It provides an abstract `file-system-like` structure with folder and files that can be backed by different underlying persistence storages - `file system`, `relational database`, `noSQL database`, etc.

In a single repository instance there are several spaces holding different types of content - users' `workspaces`, public [registry](../registry/), `search indices`, `git metadata`, `versions`, etc.
