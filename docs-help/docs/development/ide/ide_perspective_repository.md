The **Repository** perspective gives access to the raw structure of the Dirigible instance. It is comprised of Repository, Snapshot, Preview and Console views.
There the user can inspect at low level the project and folder structure, as well as the artifacts content.
The user is able to import/export snapshots via the Snapshot view.
