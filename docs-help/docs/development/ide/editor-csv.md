CSV Editor
===

The CSV editor in the Eclipse Dirigible IDE is based on the AG Grid library. The CSV editor allows you to create and manage CSV files.

## Create CSV Files
1. To create a new CSV file in the IDE, first create a project.
2. Right-click your project and create a file.
3. Finally, give the newly created file a name followed by the **.csv** extension, and press **Enter**.
To open the CSV file, double-click it. By default, the CSV file has the headers already enabled. If you want to disable the headers, click the vertical ellipsis icon ("**⋮**") to open the kebab menu, and click **Disable Header**.

## Edit CSV Files

While editing a CSV file in the Eclipse Dirigible IDE, you can perform a list of actions:

- Add a new column

  To add a column, right-click on the **Column** field and click **Add Column**.
  
  You can also edit and delete a column by right-clicking it.

- Add a new row

  To add a row, right-click on the field where rows should go and click **Add Row**.
  
  Clicking an already existing row allows you to add a new row before or after it, or delete it.

- Reorder rows

  You can use the drag icon ("**⋮⋮⋮⋮**") to change the order of existing rows by dragging and dropping them where you want them to be:

- Select rows

  You can select:
  - separate single rows with the "Cmd (macOS) / Ctrl (Linux & Windows) + left click" shortcut, or
  - multiple consequent rows with the "Shift + left click" shortcut.

  Once you've selected some rows, you can either reorder them using the drag icon ("**⋮⋮⋮⋮**") or delete them with righ-click and **Delete Row(s)**.
  
## Manage CSV Files

- Filter a CSV file

  You can filter the CSV file using these predefined filter options:
  
  - Contains
  - Not Contains
  - Equals
  - Not Equal
  - Starts With
  - Ends With

  To select one of these options, click the “**≡**” hamburger icon:
