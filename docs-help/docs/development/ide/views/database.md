Database View
===

The **Database** view gives you direct access to the configured data source(s).
It enables you to expand the schema item and see the list of all tables and views created either via the data structures models or directly via SQL script in [Statements View](https://www.dirigible.io/help/development/ide/views/statements/).

!!! note

    All created tables can be discovered under the `PUBLIC` schema _(for local deployment with **H2** database)_. The `PUBLIC` schema will appear, after the `local` data source type and the `DefaultDB` data source are selected in the upper right corner.
