Statements View

The **Statements** view is one of the most powerful tools for database management.
In the Statements console you can enter and execute SQL scripts, compliant to the underlying database system.
In order to execute an SQL statement, select the statement and press ++f8++

In [Database View](https://www.dirigible.io/help/development/ide/views/database/) you can press the refresh button, and preview the data by selecting **Show Content**. You get the result of the execution in the **Results** view.
