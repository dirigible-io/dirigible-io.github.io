Debugger Perspective
===

The Web IDE includes a Debugger perspective which is comprised of the following views:

* Debugger
* Variables
* Breakpoints

* Preview 

The Debugger perspective enables you to monitor the execution of your code, stop it, restart it or set breakpoints, and change values in memory.
