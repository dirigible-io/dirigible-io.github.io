Debugger Perspective
===

The Web IDE includes a **Debugger** perspective which is comprised of the following views:

* Debugger
* Variables
* Breakpoints
* Console
* Preview 

The **Debugger** perspective enables you to monitor the execution of your code, stop it, restart it or set breakpoints, and change values in memory.
