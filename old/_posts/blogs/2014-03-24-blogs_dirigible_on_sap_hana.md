Have you ever wondered if it is possible to develop end to end your next cloud application
directly via the browser? What language should you use? What kind of other tools should
you need for the database management, authorization definitions, testing, life-cycle
management, monitoringâ€¦?


What if you can:
* write the whole application in JavaScript? You like Ruby? What about Groovy as well? And still in the same environment?
* run directly Apache Camel's Routes as simplified integration services and scheduled jobs?<br>
* browse your database schema or catalog and execute your query and update scripts again in the same environment?<br>
