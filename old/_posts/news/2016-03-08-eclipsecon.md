On March 08 2016, presentation about "Cloud Development with Dirigible in the Eyes of a Java-saurus" was held by Vladimir Pavlov, on the [EclipseCon](https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2016/session/cloud-development-dirigible-eyes-java-saurus) at Virginia, USA.

In the session was shown how the development of cloud applications and services with Dirigible looks like - in the eyes of a hard-core veteran Java guy. There was some analogies to the Java (EE) development model and also were explored the differences between the two models.
