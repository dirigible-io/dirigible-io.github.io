Embeded [ACE Editor](https://ace.c9.io/#nav=about) in a [RAP](https://eclipse.org/rap/) environment is one of the options to open your files with. It supports syntax highlighting of the most popular development languages and data formats, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy, JSON, XML, HTML, and more.

The *Cut*, *Copy*, *Paste* and *Undo*/*Redo* actions are integrated.

The key bindings are aligned to the standard text editors.
