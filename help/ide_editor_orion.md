The default *Source Code Editor* provided in the Dirigible's Workbench perspective is the embedded version of the well known [Orion](http://orionhub.org) editor.
It supports syntax highlighting for JavaScript, HTML, CSS as well as code-completion. For the server-side JavaScript services, Dirigible supports also the cross-file code-completion based on the [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) specification and implemented with [tern.js](http://ternjs.net/).

The *Cut*, *Copy*, *Paste* and *Undo*/*Redo* actions are built-in.

The key bindings are aligned to the standard text editors.
