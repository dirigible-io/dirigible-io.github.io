Shell Command
===

### Steps


1. Create a project **shell_command_project**
2. Then create a file named **my_command.sh**
3. Replace the code with the following content:

```

uname -an
echo variable1=$variable1

```

4. Then create a **Command** named **my_command.command**
5. Replace the content with the following JSON code:

```json

{
   "description":"command description",
   "contentType":"text/plain",
   "commands":[
      {
         "os":"mac",
         "command":"sh shell_command_project/my_command.sh"
      },
      {
         "os":"linux",
         "command":"sh shell_command_project/my_command.sh"
      }
   ],
   "set":{
      "variable1":"value1"
   },
   "unset":[
      "variable2"
   ]
}

```

6. Publish the project
8. Select the *.command file in the Workspace explorer and inspect the result in the Preview:

```

    Darwin XXXXXXXXXXXXX 17.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.7.0: Thu Jun 21 22:53:14 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4570.71.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
    variable1=value1

```

> Note: The working folder is set to the registry/public space under the file-based Repository.

You can execute an arbitrary command e.g. even Node, Python, Julia, etc., by using the dirigible projects' content published and available under the registry space. For this case the given framework has to be setup in advance and the entry point executable to be added to the PATH environment variable. The standard output is redirected to the service response.
