It is already a tradition the team(s) behind the Eclipse Dirigible located at SAP Labs Sofia to take part of the InnoWeek event. This year we were quite ambitious - we planned to build an end to end system for cloud development from Idea-to-Market.
The modules we decided to be part of the initial built-in set of the plugins were:

* Define
  * Ideas
  * Solutions
  * Projects
* Develop
  * Code
  * Models
  * Issues
  * Tasks
* Discover
  * Documents
  * Databases
  * Services
  * Sites
  * Wikis
* Infrastructure
  * Clusters
  * Containers
  * Templates
  * Deployments
* Identity and Access
  * Users
  * Roles
  * Assignments
  * Profile
* Monitoring
* Market

Thanks to the team's innovation spirit the "ZEUS" project was born. It combines the best from [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cloud management capabilities with the Dirigible rapid development techniques and contributes project management utilities. The sources of the ZEUS modules can be found as usual under DirigibleLabs on GitHub - [ZEUS](https://github.com/dirigiblelabs/zeus).

The demo by Martin and Assia was great and we took the prize of the jury.

#### Congrats!
