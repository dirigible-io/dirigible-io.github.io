We are happy to announce that the Dirigible Labs space is live!

What is it?

In short this is a place at GitHub [https://github.com/dirigiblelabs](https://github.com/dirigiblelabs) where developers can collaborate and openly share their projects built with and run on Eclipse Dirigible.

There are some important points, which have to be emphasized:

* The projects are not official Eclipse Foundation projects
* The developers must not use Eclipse provided collaboration and project management services e.g Bugzilla, IPzilla, Forum, Wiki, etc.
* The projects are not obliged to follow the [Eclipse IP process](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committerguidelines.php)

Looks like a regular GitHub collaboration space? The only key difference is that:

* The developers have to sign the [Eclipse CLA](https://eclipse.org/legal/CLA.php)

Why? This will give us confidence about the authors of the contributed source code and will make the eventual contribution to Eclipse Dirigible project at later point of time much easier.

The full description of the User Guidelines can be found at [https://wiki.eclipse.org/Dirigible/DirigibleLabs](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Dirigible/DirigibleLabs)

Sounds easy, right? You always can use the [http://trial.dirigible.io](http://trial.dirigible.io) as a starting point. If you want a new repository to be created, just write an issue under [https://github.com/dirigiblelabs/dirigiblelabs](https://github.com/dirigiblelabs/dirigiblelabs) project.


#### Enjoy!
