Just recently I was on site with a customer with the task to develop an HCP extension to their
Successfactors subscription. The timelines were very tight and the team had zero experience with
HCP and its related toolset and entry points.


One option was to block some time to learn how to make use of HCP cockpit and tools and essentially halt the development during this period.


On the other hand there is Dirigible [http://www.dirigible.io/](http://www.dirigible.io/).
