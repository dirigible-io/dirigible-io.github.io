In this session we'll discuss how development of cloud applications and services with Dirigible looks like - in the eyes of a hard-core veteran Java guy. We'll draw some analogies to the Java (EE) development model and also explore how the two models differ. Which Dirigible concepts look smarter and could ease development of cloud applications and increase productivity, and in which aspects Java is still stronger and continues to strengthen its positions...
