Developers from all over the world joined this year's edition of the [JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html) conference in San Francisco, California (USA), on October 1st, 2017. Tsvetan Stoyanov and Vladimir Pavlov represented the Eclipse Dirigible cloud development platform at the conference.

We were represented by Tsvetan Stoyanov at the Eclipse booth where he gave an overview of the currently available main features of the Dirigible platform as well as the upcoming look and feel of its [soon-to-be released version 3.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZGbQOwAlYE&t=).

During these sessions, people expressed their interest by giving valuable suggestions for improvement of the Dirigible cloud development platform in terms of the overall usability of the Dirigble IDE. In general, we made quite an impression on our guests at the Eclipse booth.
