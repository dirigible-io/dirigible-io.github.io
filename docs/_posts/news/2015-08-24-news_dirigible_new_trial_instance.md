title: "New Trial Instance at Eclipse.org"

Trial instance of Dirigible has been moved to Eclipse.org - [http://dirigible.eclipse.org](http://dirigible.eclipse.org).
The old link [http://trial.dirigible.io](http://trial.dirigible.io) redirects to the same new location.

The first screen asks for selection of a nickname for instant anonymous access to Dirigible. This is required for the further workspace creation.

After accessing, the users have full access to all capabilities in a shared mode, hence do not be constructive in destruction, which will not be counted at this instance.
Instead of this you can try the new feature - injected API code-completion in Orion editor:

Enjoy!
