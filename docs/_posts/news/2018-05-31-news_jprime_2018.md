We are proud to be part of jPrime Conference again in 2018!

This time we had two workshops:

* the first one related to the Kubernetes container management and our own tool Zeus, which helps for the better overview and cataloging of the deployments; 
* and the second one showing how a production delivery of Dirigible's application can be made;

The guides from the workshops can be found here:

* [Zeus on Kubernetes](http://www.dirigible.io/samples/tutorial_zeus_on_kubernetes_minikube.html)
* [Helium Custom Stack](http://www.dirigible.io/samples/tutorial_helium_custom_stack.html)

It was quite crowded in the room both days and we were glad to even go deeper by explaining the most recent features releated to MDA tooling, such as Database Schema Modeler, BPMN Modeler and espacially the Entity Data Modeler with the Full-stack Application Templates.

It was really wonderful to see so many participants again this year in the de-facto **the biggest developer conference in Bulgaria**! Thanks again for the Go5 and all the organizers, sponsors and volunteers!
