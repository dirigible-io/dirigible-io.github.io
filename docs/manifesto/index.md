# The AI-Assisted Model-Driven Development Manifesto

*How Eclipse Dirigible closes the gap that broke Model-Driven Development for thirty years.*

---

## Preamble

Model-Driven Development was never the wrong idea. It was the right idea with the wrong front door.

For three decades the industry chased the same promise: describe a system once, at a high level of abstraction, and let a machine generate the running application from that description. The promise is sound. Where it has repeatedly failed is not in the generation - generation has always worked - but in the act of **authoring the models by hand**. The modellers were too heavy, the configuration too deep, the learning curve too steep. So the abstraction that was supposed to save time became the thing developers routed around.

This manifesto states what we are doing in Eclipse Dirigible: keeping everything that made MDD correct, and replacing the one part that made it fail. Artificial intelligence is not bolted on as a feature. It is the **authoring layer** the discipline was always missing.

---

## I. What Model-Driven Development Got Right

Strip away the tooling and MDD rests on three claims that are simply true:

1. **Two altitudes of model are enough to describe most business software.** An *abstract* model says *what* the system is (entities, relationships, processes, permissions, the data it shows and the actions it permits). A *specific* model says *how* a given platform realises it (an EDM document, a BPMN diagram, a form definition, a report query, a role and access file). The abstract model is portable intent; the specific model is a platform's deterministic interpretation of it.

2. **Generation from a model is deterministic and repeatable.** Given the same specific model, a generator produces the same full-stack application, every time, byte for byte. There is no creativity in this step and there should not be. Determinism is the entire value: the model is the source of truth, the code is a pure function of the model, and regeneration is safe.

3. **The full stack, and its extensions, are derivable.** Database schema, persistence, REST services, UI, dashboards, scheduled jobs, message listeners, process flows, security - all of it follows from the models. So do the extension points. A platform that owns the generators owns a complete, consistent application factory.

None of this is in dispute. Dirigible has shipped it for years: the [synchronizer model](/help/concepts/synchronizer-model) turns declarations on disk into a running application, and the "Generate from EDM / Schema / BPMN" templates turn models into TypeScript, Java, SQL and HTML.

The models are not the problem. They never were.

---

## II. Why Model-Driven Development Failed

The failure was always at the keyboard, not in the pipeline.

- **Too many configurations.** Every entity needs a perspective, a layout type, widget types, icons, menu keys, audit settings, relationship cardinalities, dropdown data sources, referenced properties. Every one is a correct and necessary detail of the *specific* model. Asked of a human, for every field of every entity, they become a tax that dwarfs the problem being solved.

- **Too many clicks and tweaks.** A graphical modeller turns a five-second thought ("add a country field to Customer") into a sequence of dialogs, property panels, drag-drops and save steps. The cost of *expressing* an intent came to exceed the cost of the intent itself.

- **Too steep a learning curve.** Driving the BPMN modeller, the Entity Data Model modeller, the Forms and Reports designers *correctly* is a specialist skill. Gateways, sequence flows, compositions versus associations, perspective inheritance, report joins and aggregations - each modeller is a small discipline of its own. The promise of MDD was *less* expertise required, but the modellers demanded *more*.

- **The escape hatch always won.** Because authoring the model was so costly, developers dropped to hand-written code at the first sign of friction - and once code and model diverge, the model is dead. Thirty years of MDE projects died precisely here: pure model-driven approaches with no graceful escape, abandoned the moment one real-world requirement did not fit the modeller.

The common thread: **the abstraction was sound, but the only way to reach it was through a surface humans found hostile.** MDD asked people to think like a generator. Most would not, and the ones who could were too few and too expensive.

---

## III. The Diagnosis: The Models Were Never the Problem

This is the pivot of the whole argument.

::: tip The pivot
The specific models and their deterministic generators are an asset, not a liability. The defect was the **authoring surface** - the human-operated modeller standing between a person's intent and the model.
:::

So the fix is not to throw away MDD. It is not to replace deterministic generation with a model that writes code directly (that trades a solved problem - reliable generation - for an unsolved one - reliable code synthesis). The fix is to **remove the hostile authoring surface and put a better one in its place.**

The better authoring surface is one a human can drive in seconds and a machine can keep compliant: natural language in, a structured abstract model out, deterministic specific models and a full application after that. The graphical modellers do not disappear - they remain as the precise, read-only-by-default view and the power-user's escape - but they stop being the *only* door.

---

## IV. The Shift: AI as the Authoring Layer

Artificial intelligence is good at exactly the thing MDD was bad at, and bad at exactly the thing MDD was good at. They are complementary, not competing.

- AI is excellent at **turning ambiguous human language into a structured abstract model**. "I need a small lending library: members, books, loans, and a loan needs approval over thirty days" becomes a precise declaration of entities, relations, a process and its gateway. This is the step humans found painful and AI finds natural.

- AI is **not** asked to generate the application. Code generation stays where it belongs: in the platform's deterministic generators. The model is still the contract; the application is still a pure function of the model.

So the division of labour is clean:

| Concern | Owner | Property |
|---|---|---|
| Natural language to abstract model | **AI** | helpful, fallible, supervised |
| Abstract model to specific models | **Deterministic generator** | pure function |
| Specific models to full-stack app | **Low-Code Platform templates** | pure function |

AI lives only in the first row, and even there it **proposes**; a human **accepts**. The abstract model is structured and human-authorable, so AI is an accelerator, never a single point of failure. Turn the AI off and the surface is still a structured editor a person can drive directly.

This is the sentence the manifesto exists to say:

**AI helps a human define an easy, high-level abstract model that is provably compliant with the specific models and generators a Low-Code Platform already implements.**

## V. The Three Altitudes

Dirigible expresses the discipline as three layers, each strictly above the next, each the deterministic input to the one below.

<div class="altitudes">
  <div class="altitude-source">Natural language / prompt</div>
  <div class="altitude-link"><span>AI proposes a patch; human accepts</span></div>

  <div class="altitude-card">
    <span class="altitude-num">1</span>
    <div class="altitude-body">
      <h3>Intent <em>the abstract model</em></h3>
      <p>One file, human + AI authored. Structured, diff-stable, portable.</p>
      <div class="altitude-tags">
        <span>entities</span><span>relations</span><span>processes</span><span>forms</span><span>reports</span><span>permissions</span><span>seeds</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="altitude-link"><span>deterministic generation &middot; pure functions</span></div>

  <div class="altitude-card">
    <span class="altitude-num">2</span>
    <div class="altitude-body">
      <h3>Models <em>the specific models</em></h3>
      <p>The platform's native, openable artefacts.</p>
      <div class="altitude-tags">
        <span>.edm</span><span>.model</span><span>.bpmn</span><span>.form</span><span>.report</span><span>.roles</span><span>.csvim</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="altitude-link"><span>deterministic generation &middot; the existing template engine</span></div>

  <div class="altitude-card">
    <span class="altitude-num">3</span>
    <div class="altitude-body">
      <h3>Application <em>the full stack, plus its extensions</em></h3>
      <p>Brought live by the platform exactly as any hand-modelled project.</p>
      <div class="altitude-tags">
        <span>schema</span><span>persistence</span><span>REST</span><span>UI</span><span>jobs</span><span>listeners</span><span>processes</span><span>security</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

The abstract model is **one altitude above** the models a Low-Code Platform already generates from. It does not replace them - it *authors* them. Everything below the top layer is machinery the platform has run reliably for years. AI only changes how the top layer gets written.

Critically, the abstract model emits **specific models**, never code. It stops at the `.edm`, the `.bpmn`, the `.form`. The platform's own template engine takes it from there. The intent layer is deliberately ignorant of which template will consume its output, so it can never couple itself to one generator's choices. Wrong altitude is the cardinal sin: the moment an abstract-model generator emits a `Controller.ts` or a `*.java`, the layering has collapsed and the discipline is lost.

---

## VI. Principles

These are the tenets that keep AI-assisted MDD honest. Violate one and you slide back into either the old modeller trap or the new "let the AI write the app" trap.

1. **The specific models stay canonical.** The platform's deterministic generators are the contract. AI authors *toward* them; it does not bypass them and it does not get to invent new ones at will.

2. **Generation is deterministic, top to bottom.** Identical abstract model produces identical specific models produces an identical application. Determinism is the property that makes regeneration safe and the model trustworthy as the source of truth.

3. **AI proposes; the human disposes.** Every AI contribution is a *patch* to the abstract model, previewed and accepted by a person. The AI is replaceable and optional. The abstract model is structured enough to be authored by hand when the AI misunderstands.

4. **Edit the shape of intent, not the shape of files.** "Add a country field" must be a one-line change to the abstract model, not a re-emitted, re-ordered file. The model's on-disk form is diff-stable so that AI edits stay minimal, reviewable and trustworthy.

5. **One abstract model, whole-picture.** The entire application's intent lives in one place so the AI always diffs against the full context and the human always sees the whole system at once.

6. **Structured intent, not free text.** Natural language is the *input*; the artefact is structured. The transform from abstract model to specific models is a pure deterministic function, not a second act of interpretation.

7. **Honour the escape hatch.** Real applications always have one weird requirement that no model expresses. Pure MDD that forbids escape dies on that requirement. The discipline must provide a first-class place for hand-written code that survives regeneration - declared as hook points in the abstract model, implemented alongside the generated output, never overwritten. When something cannot be expressed, the answer is to *extend the abstract model* (and teach a generator to consume it), not to leak hand-edits into generated folders.

8. **Visualisation is read-only.** Diagrams render the abstract model for a fast human read. They are not a round-trip authoring surface. Authoring is the prompt plus the structured editor; the graphical view confirms, it does not capture.

9. **The platform line is sacred: authoring artefacts get editors and an explicit generate step; only runtime artefacts get reconciled automatically.** The abstract model is an authoring artefact. It is generated in the workspace, reviewed, and published as inert source alongside the models and code it produced - never silently materialised behind the developer's back.

---

## VII. The Role of the Low-Code Platform

AI-assisted MDD is not possible without a Low-Code Platform underneath it, and this is the part that is easy to miss.

The AI can only propose an abstract model that is *compliant* because the platform has already defined, in code and proven by integration tests, exactly what a valid specific model is and exactly how it becomes an application. The generators are the grammar the AI writes against. Without them, "AI builds your app" is a demo that works once; with them, it is a factory that works every time.

So the Low-Code Platform contributes the two things AI cannot:

- **A fixed, deterministic target.** The set of specific models and their generators is finite, versioned and tested. The AI has a closed world to be correct about, not an open-ended code-writing task to be plausibly-wrong about.

- **A complete runtime.** Once the models exist, the platform supplies the database, persistence, services, security, scheduling, messaging and UI runtime that turn them into a live system. The AI never touches any of this.

Dirigible is that platform. The abstract model (intent) is the new top layer; the [EDM](/help/ide/modelers/entity-data) / [BPMN](/help/artefacts/process/bpmn) / [form](/help/ide/modelers/form-designer) / [report](/help/ide/editors/report) / [roles](/help/artefacts/security/roles) / [CSVIM](/help/artefacts/data/csvim) models and their template generators are the layer that was always here. AI-assisted MDD is the *composition* of the two.

---

## VIII. What This Is Not

To say clearly what we are doing, it helps to say what we are refusing to do.

- **This is not "AI writes the code."** Code is generated deterministically from models, as it always was. The AI operates one or two altitudes above the code and never emits it.

- **This is not a replacement for the platform.** The generators, runtime and models are the foundation, not legacy to be superseded. AI is an authoring convenience on top of a proven factory.

- **This is not a black box.** Every step is inspectable. The abstract model is human-readable and human-editable; the specific models open in the existing editors; the generated code is ordinary code. A developer can stop at any layer and take over.

- **This is not pure MDD reborn.** The escape hatch is first-class and designed in from the start, because the lesson of thirty years is that the escape hatch always wins and the only question is whether the platform planned for it or got destroyed by it.

- **This is not non-deterministic generation.** The only non-deterministic, fallible step is natural-language-to-abstract-model, and that step is always supervised and always optional.

---

## IX. The Workflow

In practice, for the developer, the whole discipline collapses to this:

1. Describe what you want, in plain language, to the AI.
2. The AI proposes a patch to the abstract model. You see the change and a diagram of its effect. You accept or refine.
3. Generate. The platform deterministically writes the specific models next to your abstract model, in your workspace.
4. Generate again, one level down. The platform's template engine turns those models into the full-stack application and its extensions.
5. Where reality does not fit, extend the abstract model or drop a hand-written implementation into the designated escape-hatch location. Regenerate freely; your override survives.
6. Publish. The platform brings the application live exactly as it would for any hand-modelled project.

No modeller expertise required to start. No clicks-and-tweaks tax to pay. No divergence between model and code. The abstraction MDD always promised, reached through a door humans will actually walk through.

---

## X. The Dream, Stated Plainly

::: info
**No code. No modelling. Just intent.**
:::

A person says what the system should do. AI shapes that into a precise, compliant abstract model. The Low-Code Platform deterministically turns the abstract model into specific models, and the specific models into a complete, running, extensible application. Each layer is inspectable, each transform below the top is a pure function, and a human is in the loop at the only point where judgement is required.

Model-Driven Development was right all along. It was waiting for an authoring layer worth using. That layer is here.
