# DSL reference

The quick lookup surface for the intent DSL: one line and one minimal snippet per construct. The
in-product assistant guide (shipped with the engine) remains the authoritative reference for
rules, edge cases and validation messages; [The `.intent` file](/help/intent/intent-file) walks a
complete worked example.

## entities

The data model - every entity becomes a table, a generated Java repository + REST controller, and
a UI page. Integer primary keys only; composition is opt-in.

```yaml
entities:
  - name: Member
    icon: user
    audit: true                # adds CreatedAt/CreatedBy/UpdatedAt/UpdatedBy
    group: master-data         # nav group in the shared application shell
    fields:
      - { name: id,   type: integer, primaryKey: true, generated: true }
      - { name: name, type: string,  required: true, length: 200 }
    relations:
      - { name: loans, kind: oneToMany, to: Loan }
  - name: Loan
    fields:
      - { name: id,    type: integer, primaryKey: true, generated: true }
      - { name: dueOn, type: date }
    relations:
      - { name: member, kind: manyToOne, to: Member, composition: true }  # detail of Member
```

## Field / relation attributes

```yaml
- { name: code,  type: string, unique: true, length: 30 }              # UNIQUE constraint
- { name: uuid,  type: uuid, major: false }                            # off the list table
- { name: total, type: decimal, precision: 18, scale: 2, readOnly: true }
- { name: number, type: string, function: DocumentTitle }              # the document title/number
- { name: Currency, kind: manyToOne, to: Currency, size: 4 }           # form width (12-col grid)
- { name: Payment, kind: manyToOne, to: Payment, show: [date, number] }  # extra read-only lookup columns
- { name: Status, kind: manyToOne, to: OrderStatus, function: EntityStatus, init: 1 }  # managed badge, seeded default
# Depends-On - cascade, narrow-to-referenced, auto-populate:
- { name: City,  kind: manyToOne, to: City, dependsOn: { relation: Country, filterBy: Country } }
- { name: UoM,   kind: manyToOne, to: UoM,  dependsOn: { relation: Product, valueFrom: UoM } }
- { name: price, type: decimal,             dependsOn: { relation: Product, valueFrom: price } }
# Static option filter - e.g. only stock-tracked products:
- { name: Product, kind: manyToOne, to: Product, where: { Type: 1 } }
```

Entity-level extras: `order: [Id, Product, Quantity, ...]` sequences form controls and list
columns; `duplicable: true` adds a Duplicate button on a document (clones header + items through
the normal create path); `imports: |` injects Java import lines into the generated repository
(pairs with calculated actions); `aggregate: true` on a document master's numeric field keeps it
equal to the sum of the items' same-named field (the totals footer).

## function - presentation role

Optional and authoritative when set; inferred from structure otherwise.

```yaml
- name: ProjectTimesheet
  function: Document           # header + line items + status pill + totals
- name: EmployeeTimesheet
  function: DocumentItem       # its line items (no "*Item" naming needed)
```

Values: `Document`, `DocumentItem`, `Master`, `Detail`, `List`, `Setting` (entity);
`DocumentTitle` (field); `EntityStatus` (relation).

## checks - declarative validations

Row-level `exactlyOne` on every user write; document-level `itemsMin` / `itemsSumEqual` gated on
a status transition - drafting stays unconstrained, and a failing transition aborts with the
authored message.

```yaml
- name: JournalEntry
  checks:
    - { kind: itemsMin,      count: 1, status: 2, message: "An entry needs at least one line" }
    - { kind: itemsSumEqual, over: [debit, credit], status: 2, message: "Debits must equal credits" }
- name: JournalEntryItem
  checks:
    - { kind: exactlyOne, fields: [debit, credit], message: "Exactly one of debit/credit" }
```

## immutableWhen / immutable - user-write immutability

```yaml
- name: JournalEntry
  immutableWhen: "Status == 2"   # while POSTED, REST update/delete return 409 (join terms with ||)
- name: InvoiceSnapshot
  immutable: true                # append-only: e.g. the frozen copy stored when an invoice is SENT
```

`immutableWhen` requires a `function: EntityStatus` relation; `immutable: true` needs none and is
mutually exclusive with it. Workflow/system writes through the repository stay possible -
corrections to an immutable record are flow-generated reversals, never edits. (`immutableIn:` is
the pre-rename spelling, rejected with a migration message.)

## hierarchy / leafOnly - tree entities

```yaml
- name: Account
  hierarchy: Parent                                        # the tree edge (self-relation)
  relations:
    - { name: Parent, kind: manyToOne, to: Account }
# elsewhere - only leaf accounts are referenceable (server-enforced):
- { name: Account, kind: manyToOne, to: Account, model: accounts, leafOnly: true }
```

The list renders as an expandable tree; the server rejects cycles and leaf-only references to a
node with children.

## multilingual - translated master data

```yaml
languages: [en, bg]            # the languages this module PROVIDES translations for
entities:
  - name: UoM
    kind: setting
    multilingual: true         # sibling <TABLE>_LANG table; reads overlay per Accept-Language
```

Translations are seeds with a `language:` code (see [seeds](#seeds-initial-data)). The
platform's supported language set is `DIRIGIBLE_APPLICATION_LANGUAGES`.

## Calculated fields / actions

Neutral arithmetic expressions run on the server and preview live in the UI; date functions
included. For logic beyond an expression, a hand-written `CalculatedField` component is called
out.

```yaml
- { name: net, type: decimal, calculatedOnCreate: "Quantity * Price", calculatedOnUpdate: "Quantity * Price" }
- { name: days, type: decimal, readOnly: true,
    calculatedOnCreate: "businessDaysBetween(FromDate, ToDate)" }     # also daysBetween, monthsBetween
- { name: number, type: string, calculatedActionOnCreate: SalesInvoiceNumberAction }  # + entity imports:
```

## view - calendar, range, slots

```yaml
- name: EmployeeDayAllocation
  view: calendar                                   # month/week calendar of records
  calendar: { start: day, title: note }            # start (date/timestamp) required; end/title/color optional
- name: VacationRequest
  view: range                                      # from-to bars (leave calendar)
  calendar: { start: fromDate, end: toDate }
- name: Appointment
  view: slots                                      # slot-picker booking page
  slots: { start: startTime }
```

## uses - cross-model references

Entities owned by another intent model are referenced read-only (a projection + FK + dropdown -
no local table/DAO). Generate leaf-first so the owner's model exists. See
[Multi-model applications](/help/intent/multi-model).

```yaml
uses:
  - { model: countries }
entities:
  - name: Supplier
    relations:
      - { name: Country, kind: manyToOne, to: Country, model: countries }
```

Many-to-many is an explicit intermediate entity (composition to one side + `manyToOne` to the
other, plus bridge fields); `manyToMany` is parsed but never materialized.

## processes - workflows

```yaml
processes:
  - name: OrderApproval
    trigger: { onCreate: Order }
    steps:
      - { name: review,   kind: userTask, args: { assignee: manager, form: ApproveOrder } }
      - { name: decide,   kind: decision, args: { if: "action == 'approve'", then: activate, else: cancel } }
      - { name: activate, kind: serviceTask, args: { setRelationField: Status, value: 2, next: end } }
      - name: number
        kind: serviceTask
        args: { delegate: custom.orders.NumberDelegate, fields: { type: "Order" }, next: end }
      - { name: cancel,   kind: serviceTask, args: { setRelationField: Status, value: 3, next: end } }
      - { name: end,      kind: end }
```

Service-task shapes: `setField` / `setRelationField` (generated handlers), `delegate` (a reusable
hand-written client `JavaDelegate` with injected `fields`). Decisions may test `relation.field`
paths (`customer.creditLimit > 10000`) - resolvers are generated. Tasks surface in the Inbox and
inline on the record's page.

## forms - task UI

```yaml
forms:
  - name: ApproveOrder
    forEntity: Order
    fields: [orderDate, total, customer.name]     # fields or one-hop relation.field
    actions: [approve, reject]                    # complete the BPM task
```

## actions - custom buttons

```yaml
actions:
  - name: OpenPortal
    forEntity: Order
    scope: entity            # per-record; 'page' = whole-view toolbar
    page: /services/web/myapp/custom/portal.html
```

## generates - create-from

```yaml
generates:
  - name: invoice-from-timesheet
    from: ProjectTimesheet
    to: SalesInvoice
    uses: sales                       # model alias when the target is cross-model
    map: { Customer: Customer }
    defaults: { InvoiceDate: now }
    items: { from: ProjectTimesheetItem, to: SalesInvoiceItem, map: { Description: Description } }
```

Adds a button on the source view; the clone saves through the target's repository so numbering,
status init and calculated fields fire.

## postings - source-document to ledger

When a (usually cross-model) source document reaches a status, create one local document with
computed multi-line content. Idempotent via the back-reference; a missing rule or account skips
(the unposted worklist), never throws.

```yaml
postings:
  - name: salesInvoicePosting
    event: { onTransition: SalesInvoice, model: sales-invoices, when: "Status == 3" }
    creates: JournalEntry
    backReference: SalesInvoice
    map: { entryDate: date, reason: "Sales invoice {number}" }
    rule: { entity: PostingRule, match: { documentType: "Sales Invoice" } }
    items:
      - { Account: rule(receivableAccount), debit: "Net + Vat" }
      - { Account: rule(revenueAccount),    credit: "Net" }
      - { Account: rule(vatAccount),        credit: "Vat", when: "Vat != 0" }
```

## expansions - child rows from a date span

```yaml
expansions:
  - name: installments
    from: Loan
    into: LoanInstallment
    unit: month                                     # day (default) | week | month
    between: { start: startDate, end: endDate }
    map: { dueDate: period }
    spread: { total: principal, into: amount, round: 2 }   # last row absorbs the remainder
    count: periods
```

A span change replaces the generated child set; never mix hand-entered rows into an expanded
child.

## rollups - denormalised parent totals

```yaml
rollups:
  - { name: memberLoanCount, entity: Loan, via: member, field: loanCount }        # count
  - { name: invoicePaid, entity: Allocation, via: SalesInvoice, field: paid,      # sum + balance + status
      op: sum, of: amount, capacity: total, balance: balance,
      status: Status, statusWhenFull: 7, statusWhenPartial: 6 }
```

Roll-ups compose transitively across a multi-level composition (leaf edit → mid total → top
total); recomputation stops when values stop changing.

## settlements - payment allocation

```yaml
settlements:
  - name: autoAllocate
    junction: SalesInvoiceCustomerPayment
    invoice: SalesInvoice
    payment: CustomerPayment
    amount: amount
    total: total
    paid: paid
    pot: amount
    order: date                       # allocate oldest first
    match: [Customer, Currency]
    status: Status
    payableStatuses: [3, 4, 6]
```

Generates the on-payment spread handler and an on-invoice pull delegate; pair with a `rollups`
sum entry that maintains `paid`/`balance`/status.

## reports - read-only aggregations

```yaml
reports:
  - name: OrdersByMonth
    source: Order
    dimensions: ["month(orderDate)"]          # month()/year() bucket dates; relation.field joins
    measures: ["count(*)", "sum(total)"]
    filter: "total > 0"
    chart: bar                                # render as a chart page
    widget: { value: "sum(total)", at: { "month(orderDate)": now }, label: Revenue (this month) }
  - name: TrialBalance
    kind: balance                             # opening / period / closing debit+credit per dimension
    source: JournalEntryItem
    date: journalEntry.entryDate              # runtime From/To pickers
    debit: debit
    credit: credit
    dimensions: [account.code, account.name]
    filter: "journalEntry.status == 2"
```

In `filter:`, reference relations via `relation.field` (translated to a JOIN); a bare relation
name passes into the SQL untranslated.

## widgets - custom dashboard tiles

```yaml
widgets:
  - { name: SystemHealth, kind: kpi,  url: /services/js/myapp/custom/health.js, icon: activity }
  - { name: SalesFunnel,  kind: page, url: /services/web/myapp/custom/funnel/index.html }
```

## seeds - initial data

```yaml
seeds:
  - name: statuses
    entity: OrderStatus
    rows:
      - { id: 1, name: DRAFT }
      - { id: 2, name: POSTED }
  - name: cities
    entity: City
    rows:
      - { id: 1, name: Sofia, Country: 34 }   # FK by the relation's authored name (case-sensitive)
  - name: countries
    entity: Country
    file: data/countries.csv                  # large sets: developer-owned CSV in a subfolder
  - name: uoms-bg
    entity: UoM
    language: bg                              # translations for a multilingual entity (_LANG)
    rows:
      - { id: 1, name: "Килограм" }
```

Row keys must match a field or relation name exactly (case-sensitive).

## notifications - email on change

```yaml
notifications:
  - name: welcomeMember
    event: { onCreate: Member }               # exactly one of onCreate/onUpdate/onDelete
    to: email                                 # a field, one-hop relation.field, or a literal
    subject: "Welcome"
    body: "Your membership is active."
```

## schedules - cron

Per matching row, exactly one of `notify` or `generate`:

```yaml
schedules:
  - name: monthlyTimesheets
    cron: "0 0 1 1 * ?"
    entity: Employee                          # the schedule's SOURCE must be local
    where:
      - { field: status, op: eq, value: ACTIVE }
    generate:
      to: EmployeeTimesheet                   # cross-model target via `uses:` alias
      map: { Employee: id }
      defaults: { Period: now }
```

## integrations - outbound HTTP

```yaml
integrations:
  - { name: pushNewMember, event: { onCreate: Member }, method: POST, url: "https://api.example.com/members" }
```

## inbound - webhooks

```yaml
inbound:
  - { name: leadHook, path: /webhooks/lead, create: Lead }
```

## permissions - roles

```yaml
permissions:
  - { role: Librarian, can: [Member:read, Member:write, Loan:approve] }
```

## Print, tests and the shell (generated automatically)

Every document (header-items) master also gets a standard `<Entity>.print` template (the Print
button renders PDF via the document-template engine, per-language via CMS folders - see
[Printing and documents](/help/intent/printing)), a `<name>.test` UI-test manifest, and its
perspective in the generated SPA + the shared application shell (dashboard, Inbox, Documents,
Reports, Settings including Region & Language).

## Planned - recognised but not yet implemented

- Other reserved `function` values for upcoming templates are recognised but rejected with a
  clear "not yet available" message. (`function: Calendar` is now first-class - the role alias
  for `view: calendar`.)
- **`manyToMany`** - parsed but never materialized; the supported shape is the explicit
  intermediate entity.
- **Declarative glue actions beyond the current set**: publish/consume message,
  `generateDocument` (PDF), `assign`, process-step events, inbound message/file events. Today's
  implemented glue: triggers, decision/form resolvers, notifications, schedules, integrations,
  inbound webhooks, rollups, settlements, expansions, generates, postings.
- **Cross-model schedule source** - a schedule's `entity` must be local (the generate target may
  be cross-model).
- ~~`generates` completion hook~~ - landed: `sourceStatus` flips the source's status after the
  target is created.
- **Embedded calendar panel for a dependent composition child** inside its master page -
  calendar views require a primary entity today.
