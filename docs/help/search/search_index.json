Here you will find resources to help you create even better documentation for Dirigible. Contributor Guide Eclipse Dirigible is an open source project, which means that you can propose contributions by sending pull requests through GitHub . Before you get started, here are some prerequisites that you need to complete: Legal considerations Please read the Eclipse Foundation policy on accepting contributions via Git . Please read the Code of Conduct . Your contribution cannot be accepted unless you have an Eclipse Contributor Agreement in place. Here is the checklist for contributions to be acceptable: Create an account at Eclipse Add your GitHub user name in your account settings Log into the projects portal , look for \"Eclipse Contributor Agreement\" , and agree to the terms. Ensure that you sign-off your Git commits with the same email address as your Eclipse Foundation profile. For more information see the Contributor Guide . Style Guide In this section we have outlined text stylizing options and for what elements they should be used. If everyone follows it, we will have visually consistent documentation . Bold How it looks as text: Bold Text How it looks in markdown: **Bold Text** Use it for: UI elements Navigation paths Monospace How it looks as text: Monospace Text How it looks in markdown: `Monospace Text` Use it for: File names and extensions Terms File paths Monospace/Bold How it looks as text: Monospace/Bold Text How it looks in markdown: **`Monospace/Bold Text`** Use it for: User input Headings How it looks: Use Heading 1 for the titles Heading 2 is for main topics Continue with Heading 3 and 4 where needed Structure your topic with no more than 3 heading levels(heading 2, 3 and 4) Blogs We'd welcome any contribution to our Blogs site as long as it conforms with out Legal considerations outlined above. Below we've provided more details about the organization of the Blogs site and the frontmatter that needs to be added so new blogs have the same look and feel as all the others. Add Your Blog to the Right Folder All blogs are organized in folders by year, month, and day of publishing. Hence, a blog written on November 19, 2020 is placed in the directory docs/2020/11/19/ : This also helps arranging the blogs by year of publishing. When publishing, add your blog to the right folder depending on the date. You can also create folders if needed. Include Markdown Frontmatter A big part of any blog's layout is controlled by its .md file frontmatter. This is metadata about the .md file and is denoted by the triple dashes at the start and end of the block. Here's an example with the title of this Community page: --- title : Community --- Welcome to the community page for contributors! Here you will find resources to help you create even better documentation for Dirigible. ## Contributor Guide Set the title of the blog in the frontmatter: --- title : <Your Blog Title> --- When the title is set in the frontmatter, use Heading 2 level ( ## This is a heading 2 ) as the highest heading level in your blog. Otherwise, the first Heading 1 you use will overwrite the title from the frontmatter and cause formatting issues. Set the author: --- title : <Your Blog Title> author : <Your Name> --- Set your GitHub user: --- title : <Your Blog Title> author : <Your Name> author_gh_user : <Your GitHub User> --- 4.

Setup Trial Environment In case you are using the shared https://trial.apps.dirigible.io environment, you can skip this section. Get the binary In case you want to use a prebuild package, you can get the one built for your environment from the downloads section. To build Eclipse Dirigible from sources by yourself, just follow the instructions in the README . Choose the environment You can choose one of the setup options available to get an Eclipse Dirigible instance depending on your target environment. A shared trial instance is also available and can be accessed from here: https://trial.apps.dirigible.io Environment Variables There are many configuration options , so you can connect to different databases, use different platforms, choose a specific set of plugins, and many more. Access the instance In case of a local setup on your machine, you can access Eclipse Dirigible at the following location: http://localhost:8080 Default Credentials The default username is admin and the default password is admin . The credentials can be updated, as described in the configuration options . Hello World Application Create a Hello World service Once you have a running Eclipse Dirigible instance, you can start with your project: Right-click inside the Projects view. From the menu select the New Project option. Enter hello-world for the name of the project and click the Create button. Right-click on the hello-world project in the Projects view and choose TypeScript or JavaScript ECMA6 service from the New dropdown: TypeScript JavaScript ECMA6 Select the New \u2192 TypeScript Service option: Enter service.ts for the name of the TypeScript Service : Double-click on the service.ts to open the file in the editor on the right. Info The file already contains a Hello World service implementation. As it's not specified otherwise, the service can be executed by performing any of the following HTTP methods: GET , POST , PUT , DELETE and PATCH . Right-click on the hello-world project and choose Publish option from the menu: With the service.ts selected in the Projects view, check the result of the execution of the server-side TypeScript Service in the Preview view: Note The TypeScript Service is published and available at the http://localhost:8080/services/ts/hello-world/service.ts URL. It can be accessed in a separate browser tab, consumed by a third-party application or API tools like Postman or cURL . Select the New \u2192 JavaScript ESM Service option: Enter service.mjs for the name of the JavaScript ESM Service : Double-click on the service.mjs to open the file in the editor on the right. Info The file already contains a Hello World service implementation. As it's not specified otherwise, the service can be executed by performing any of the following HTTP methods: GET , POST , PUT , DELETE and PATCH .

Workspace Next is the concept of a workspace that is very similar to the well known workspace from desktop IDEs (e.g., Eclipse). The workspace can hold one or more projects. One user can have multiple workspaces, but can work in only one at a given moment of time. Registry Registry and the related publishing processes are taken from the SOA (UDDI) and recent API management trends to bring some of their strengths, such as discoverability, reusability, loose coupling, relevance, etc. Generation To boost the development productivity at the very initial phase, we introduced template-based generation of application artifacts via wizards. Entity Services The new Web 2.0 paradigm and the leveraged REST architectural style changed the way services should behave and be described. Although there is push for bilateral contracts only and free description of the services, we decided to introduce a more sophisticated kind of services for special purposes - entity services . Modeling This is the visual definition of database schema models, entity data models, and BPMN processes. In Eclipse Dirigible, modeling is enabled by several editors and modelers .

The overall process of building dynamic applications lies on well-known and proved principles: In-system development - known from microcontrollers to business software systems. A major benefit is working on a live system where all changes you make take effect immediately, hence the impact and side effects can be realized in the early stages of the development process. Content-centric - known from networking to development processes in the context of dynamic applications it comprises. All the artifacts are text-based models or executable scripts stored in a generic repository (along with the related binaries, such as images). This makes the life-cycle management of the application itself and the transport between the landscapes (Dev/Test/Prod) straight forward. In result, you can set up the whole system only by pulling the content from a remote source code repository such as git . Scripting languages - programming languages written for a special runtime environment that can interpret (rather than compile) the execution of tasks. Dynamic languages existing nowadays, as well as the existing smooth integration in the Web servers, make the rise of the in-system development in the cloud possible. Shortest turn-around time - the driving principle for our tooling because instant access and instant value are some of the most important requirements for the developers. In general, components of a dynamic application can be separated into the following categories: Data structures - The artifacts representing the domain model of the application. In our case, we have chosen the well-accepted JSON format for describing a normalized entity model.

Entity services - Once we have the domain model entities, next step is to expose them as Web services.

Support for creating unit tests is important and is, therefore, integrated as an atomic part of the scripting support itself - you can use the same language for the tests as the one for the services themselves. User interface - Web 2.0 paradigm, as well as HTML5 specification, bring the Web UI to another level. There are already many cool client-side AJAX frameworks that you can use depending on the nature of your application.

Overview Let\u2019s have a closer look at the methods shown in the example above. First, we requested a new REST service instance from the framework: rs.service() Next, we configured the instance to serve HTTP GET requests sent to root path (\"\") using the supplied function: . resource ( \"\" ) . get ( function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( \"Hello there!\" ); }) Technically, configuration is not required to execute a service, but obviously it will do nothing, if you don't instruct it what to do. Finally, we run the service and it processes the HTTP request: .execute(); Now, this is a fairly simplistic example aiming to give you a hint of how you can bring up a REST API to life with http-rs. There is a whole lot more that we shall explore in the next sections. Creating REST services rs.service() Creating new service instances is as simple as invoking rs.service() . That returns a configurable and/or executable instance of the HttpController class. The controller API allows to: - start configuring REST service (method resource() ) - serve requests (method execute() ) - perform a couple of more advanced activities, which will be reviewed in the Advanced section below Additionally, the controller API features also shortcut factory methods that are useful for simplistic configurations (like the one in our initial example) such as get(sPath, fServe, arrConsume, arrProduces) . Read below for more examples how to use the methods. Serving requests execute() The mechanism for serving requests is implemented in the execute() method of the HttpController. It tries to match the request to the service API configuration. If the mechanism matches the request successfully, it triggers the execution flow of the callback functions. The execution flow processes the request and response. If the mechanism doesn't match the request successfully, it sends a Bad Request error to the client. The request and response objects are implicitly those that were used to request the script where the execute() method invocation occurred. But they can be exchanged for others as shown in the Advanced section. The execute() method is defined in the service instance (class HttpController) obtained with rs.service() . The execute() method can be triggered with rs.service().execute() . The rs API configuration also provides numerous references to the method so you can invoke it on any stage. For example, rs . service (). get ( \"\" ). execute () rs . service (). resource ( \"\" ). get (). execute () rs . service (). resource ( \"\" ). get (). produces ([ \"text/json\" ]). execute () are all valid ways to serve requests. What you need to consider is that execute() must be the final method invocation. Even if you retain a reference to a configuration object and change it after that, it will be irrelevant since the response will be flushed and closed by then. Configuring services There are three options as far as configuration is concerned. You can start from scratch and build the configuration using the rs API. You can use configuration objects. They are holding the configuration that the rs API produces. You can start with a configuration object and then enhance or override the configuration using the rs API. Configuration objects A configuration object is a JS object with canonical structure that the http-rs can interpret. We will discuss its schema later on in this guide. For now, let's just consider that it's the same thing that the rs-fluent API will actually produce behind the scenes so it's a completely valid alternative and complement to the rs-fluent API configuration approach. Refer to the Advanced section for more details on using configuration objects. Defining service resources resource(sPath, oConfiguration?) Resources are the top-level configuration objects that represent an HTTP (server) resource , for which we will be defining a protocol. Each resource is identified by a URL on the server. You can have multiple resources per service configuration, provided that their URLs do not overlap. Resource vs Path vs Resource Path As per the REST terms, a resource is an abstraction or a server-side resource that can be a file, a dynamically generated content, or a procedure (although the last is considered heresy by purists). It's virtually anything hosted on a server that has an address and can be accessed with a standard HTTP method. It is often referred to as \"path\" or \"resource path\" due to its singular most notable identifying characteristic. But to be precise, \"path\" is only a property of the resource. As far as configuration is concerned, the resource defines the configuration scope for which we define method handlers and constraints, and is identifiable by its \"path\" property. Resource paths and path templates The sPath string parameter (mandatory) of the resource() method will serve as the resource URL. It is relative to the location where the JavaScript service is running (e.g. /services/v4/my-application/api/my-service.js ). No path ( \"\" ), request directly to the JavaScript service root ( \"\" ) path. The path can also be a URL template, i.e. parameterized. For example consider the path template: {id}/assets/{assetType}/{name} This will resolve request paths such as: /services/js/test.js/1/assets/longterm/building to service path: 1/assets/longterm/building If a request is matched to such path, the service mechanism will provide the resolved parameters as an object map to the function that handles the request. Using the sample path above the path parameters object will look like this: { \"id\" : 1 , \"assetType\" : \"longterm\" , \"name\" : \"building\" } Defining HTTP methods allowed for a resource resource . get () resource . post () resource . put () resource [ \"delete\" ]() and resource . remove () resource . method () By default, only the HTTP request methods that you have configured for a resource are allowed. The fluent API of Resource instances, obtained with the resource(sPath) method that we discussed above, exposes the most popular REST API methods ( get , post , put and delete ). They are simply aliases for the generic method method . Whichever we consider, we will receive a ResourceMethod instance from the invocation and its API will allow us to specify processing functions and further specify constraints on the request/response for which they are applicable: rs.resource('').get().produces([\"application/json\"]).serve(function(){}) Alternatively, as we have already seen, we can supply the serve callback function directly as first argument to the method, which comes in handy if we have nothing more to setup: rs.resource('').get(function(){}) We can also use configuration object as a third option and this will be discussed in the Advanced section. The samples here are all for configuring HTTP GET Method but the usage pattern is still the same for all: rs.resource('').post().consumes([\"application/json\"]).serve(function(){}) Shortcuts You already noticed that instead of explicitly using serve to configure callback for serving the requests we could directly provide the function as argument to the method configuring the HTTP method (e.g. get ). rs.resource('').get(function(){}) rs.resource('').get().serve(function(){}) So why bother provisioning an explicit serve() function in the first place then? The answer is that serve() configures only one of the callback functions that are triggered during the request processing flow. And this shortcut is handy if it is only serve() that you are interested into configuring. Of course, nothing prevents you also from using the shortcut and still configure the other callback functions, unless you find it confusing. These are all valid options. Find out more about configuring request processing callback functions in the section dedicated to this. When the controller API was discussed, it was mentioned that there are shortcut factory methods that combine a couple operations to produce directly a method handler for a resource path. Example rs . service () . get ( \"\" , function ( ctx , request , response ) { response . print ( 'ok' ); }) . execute (); That would be equivalent to the following: rs . service () . resource ( \"\" ) . get ( function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . print ( 'ok' ); }) . execute (); These shortcut methods share the same names with those in Resource that are used for defining HTTP method handlers: get , post , put , delete and its alias remove , but differ in signature (first argument is a string for the resource path) and the return type (the HttpController instance, instead of ResourceMethod). They are useful as a compact mechanism if you intend to build something simple and simplistic, such as a single resource and one or few handler functions for it. You will not be able to go much further with this API so if you consider anything even slightly more sophisticated you should look into the fluent API of resource instead: rs.service().resource(\"\") . Note Note that the scope of these shortcut methods is the controller, not the resource. That has effect on the method chaining. For clean code, do not confuse despite the similar names and avoid mixing them. Defining content types that an API consumes and produces rs . resource ( \"\" ). get (). produces ( \"[application/json]\" ) rs . resource ( \"\" ). post (). consumes ( \"[application/json]\" ) rs . resource ( \"\" ). put (). consumes ( \"[application/json]\" ). produces ( \"[application/json]\" ) Optionally, but also quite likely, we will add some constraints on the data type consumed and produced by the resource method handler that we configure. At request processing runtime, these constraints will be matched for compatibility against the HTTP request headers before delegating to the handler processing function. You can use wildcards (*) in the MIME types arguments both for type and sub-type and it will be considered as anything during the execution: rs . resource ( \"\" ). post (). consumes ( \"[*/json]\" ) rs . resource ( \"\" ). post (). consumes ( \"[*/*]\" ) Request processing flow and events Before we continue, let us take a look at the request processing flow. The request is matched against the resource method handling definitions in the configuration and if there is a compatible one it is elicited for execution. Otherwise, a Bad request error is returned back to the client. The before callback function is invoked if any was configured. The serve callback function is invoked if any was configured. If an Error was thrown from the serve function, a catch callback function is invoked. The callback function is either configured or the default one. A finally (always executed) function is invoked if one was configured. Or in pseudocode: try { before ( ctx , request , response , resourceMethod , controller ); serve ( ctx , request , response , resourceMethod , controller ); } catch ( err ){ catch ( ctx , err , request , response , resourceMethod , controller ); } finally { finally (); } As evident form the flow, it is only the serve event callback handler function that is required to be setup. But if you require fine grained reaction to the other events, you can configure handlers for each of those you are interested in. Currently, the API supports a single handler function per event so in multiple invocation of a setup method on the same resource method only the last will matter. Defining event handling functions resource . get (). before ( function ( ctx , request , response , resourceMethod , controller ){ //Implements pre-processing logic }) resource . get (). serve ( function ( ctx , request , response , resourceMethod , controller ){ //Implements request-processing logic }) resource . get (). catch ( function ( ctx , error , request , response , resourceMethod , controller ){ //Implements error-processing logic overriding the default }) resource . get (). finally ( function (){ //Implements post-processing logic regardless of error or success of the serve function }) A valid, executable resource method configuration requires at least the serve callback function to be setup: resource . get (). serve ( function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( 'OK' ); }); The rest are optional and/or have default implementations. Errors thrown from the before and serve callbacks are delegated to the catch callback. There is a default catch callback that sends formatted error back in the response and it can be overridden using the catch method to setup another error processing logic. The finally callback is invoked after the response has been flushed and closed (regardless if in error or success) and can be used to cleanup resources. Example: rs . service (). resource ( \"\" ) . get () . before ( function ( ctx , request , response ){ request . setHeader ( 'X-arestme-version' , '1.0' ); }) . serve ( function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( 'Serving GET request' ); }) . catch ( function ( ctx , err , request , response ){ console . error ( err . message ); }) . finally ( function (){ console . info ( 'GET request processing finished' ); }) Advanced Using configuration objects Configuration objects are particularly useful when you are enhancing or overriding an existing protocol so you don't start configuring from scratch but rather amend or change pieces of the configuration. It is also useful when you are dealing with dynamically generated HTTP-based protocol configurations. For example, consider the simple sample that we started with. It is completely identical with this one, which uses a configuration object and provides it to the service function: rs . service ({ \"\" : { \"get\" : [{ \"serve\" : function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( \"Hello there!\" ); } }] } }). execute (); It is also completely identical with this one: rs . service () . resource ( \"\" , { \"get\" : [{ \"serve\" : function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( \"Hello there!\" ); } }] }). execute (); or this one: rs . service () . resource ( \"\" ) . get ([{ \"serve\" : function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( \"Hello there!\" ); } }]). execute (); In fact, here is a sample how to define a whole API providing configuration directly to the service method and then enhance it. rs . service ({ \"\" : { \"get\" : [{ \"serve\" : function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( \"Hello there!\" ); } }] } }) . resource ( \"\" ) . post () . serve ( function ( ctx , request , response ){ console . info ( request . readText ()); }) . execute (); In this way we essentially are exploiting the fluent API to configure a service but we will not start from scratch. Many of the API methods accept as a second argument configuration object and this doesn't prevent you to continue the API design with fluent API to enhance or override it. The sendError method in HttpController The HttpController class instances that we receive when rs.service() is invoked, features a sendError method. It implements the logic for formatting errors and returning them back to the client taking into account its type and content type preferences. Should you require to change this behavior globally you can redefine the function. If you require different behavior for particular resources or resource method handlers, then using the catch callback is the better approach. Sometimes it's useful to reuse the method and send error in your handler functions. The standard request processing mechanism in HttpController does not account for logical errors. It doesn't know for example that a parameter form a client input is out of valid range. For such cases you would normally implement validation either in before event handler or in serve. And if you need tighter control on what is sent back, e.g. the HTTP code you wouldn't simply throw an Error but invoke the sendError function with the right parameters yourself. For these purposes the last argument of each event handler function is conveniently the controller instance. rs . service (). resource ( \"\" ) . get () . before ( function ( ctx , request , response , methodHandler , controller ){ //check if requested file exists if ( ! file . exists ()){ controller . sendError (); } }) . serve ( function (){ //return file content }) Defining readonly APIs mappings.readonly() An obvious way of defining readonly APIs is to use only GET resource methods definitions. In some cases though APIs can be created from external configuration that also contains other resource method handlers, or we can receive an API instance from another module factory, or we want to support two instances of the same API, one readonly and one with edit capabilities, with minimal code. In such cases, we already have non-GET resource methods that we have to get rid of somehow. Here the readonly method steps in and does exactly this - removes all but the GET resource handlers if any. Example: rs . service () . resource ( \"\" ) . post () . serve ( function (){}); . get () . serve ( function (){}); . readonly () . execute (); If you inspect the configuration after .readonly() is invoked (use resource(\"\").configuration() ) you will notice that the post verb definition is gone. Consecutively, POST requests to this resource will end up in Bad Request (400). Note that for this to work, this must be the last configuration action for a resource. Otherwise, you are resetting the resource configuration to readonly, only to define write methods again. The readonly method is available both for ResourceMapping and Resource objects returned by either invocations of service mappings() method or retained references from configuration API invocations. Disabling a ResourceMethod Handler api.disable(sPath, sVerb, arrConsumesTypes, arrProducesTypes) Similar to the use cases explored for the readonly method above yo might not be in full control of the definition of the API, but rather takeover at some point. Similar to the readonly method, this one will remove the handler definition identified by the four parameters - resource path, resource verb, consumes constraint array (not necessarily in same order), produces constraint array (not necessarily in same order), but it will do it for any verb, not only GET . In that sense readonly is a specialization of this one only for GET verbs. Example: var mappings = rs . service ({ \"\" : { \"post\" : [{ serve : function (){} }], \"get\" : [{ serve : function (){} }] } }). mappings (); mappings . disable ( \"\" , \"post\" ); With this API definition, invoking mappings.find(\"\",\"get\") will return a reference to the only get handler defined there and you can manage it. Note that you get a reference to the configuration and not an API. Example: // add produces constraint and redefine the serve callback var mappings = rs . service (). get ( function (){}). mappings (); //later in code var handler = mappings . find ( \"\" , \"get\" ); handler . produces = [ \"application/json\" ] handler . serve = function (){ console . info ( \"I was redefined\" ); } Executing service with explicit request/response arguments The request and response parameters of the execute method are optional. If you don't supply them, the service will take the request/response objects that were used to request the script. Most of the time this is what you want. However, supplying your own request and response arguments can be very handy for testing as you can easily mock and inspect them. Fluency for execute method The execute method is defined by the service instance (HttpController) obtained with rs.service() and can be executed with: rs.service().execute() . The fluent configuration API also provides references to the method, so you can actually invoke it on any stage. Examples: rs . service (). resource ( \"\" ). get ( function (){}). execute () rs . service (). resource ( \"\" ). get (). serve ( function (){}). execute () rs . service (). resource ( \"\" ). get (). produces ([ \"text/json\" ]). serve ( function (){}). execute () rs . service () . resource ( \"\" ) . produces ([ \"application/json\" ]) . get ( function (){}) . resource ( \"\" ) . consumes ([ \"*/json\" ]) . post ( function (){}) . execute () Mappings vs Configurations The API supplies two methods mappings() and configuration() that provide configuration in two forms. The mappings method supplies typed API objects such as Resource aggregating ResourceMethod instances. To get a reference to a service mappings, invoke mappings on the service instance: rs.service().mappings() With a reference to mappings you have their fluent API at disposal. This is useful when extending and enhancing the core rs functionality to build dedicated services. For example the HttpController constructor function is designed to accept mappings and if you extend or initialize it internally in another API you will likely need this form of configuration. An invocation of the configuration method on the other hand provides the underlying JS configuration object. It can be used to supply generic configurations that are used to initialize new types of services as the public fluent API is designed to accept this form of configuration. Both are represent configuration but while the mappings are sort of internal, parsed version, the configuration object is the version that the public api accepts and is also therefore kind of advanced public form of the internal configuration. It is also possible to convert between the two: rs . service ( jsConfig ). mappings () rs . service (). resource (). configuration () Finding a ResourceMethod rs.service().mappings().find(sPath, sMethod, arrConsumesTypes, arrProducesTypes) Suppose you want to redefine a handler definition to e.g. change the serve callback, add a before handler, change or add to the consumes media types constraint etc. To do that you need a reference to the handler, which is identified by the four parameters - resource path , resource method , consumes constraint array (not necessarily in same order), produces constraint array (not necessarily in same order). On a successful search hit you get a reference to the handler definition and can perform changes on it. Example: rs . service () . resource ( \"\" ) . get ( function (){}); With this API definition, invoking rs.service().mappings().find(\"\",\"get\") will return a reference to the only get handler defined there and you can manage it. Note that you get a reference to the configuration and not an API. Example: // add produces constraint and redefine the serve callback var handler = svc . mappings (). find ( \"\" , \"get\" ); handler . produces = [ \"application/json\" ] handler . serve = function (){ console . info ( \"I was redefined\" ); } With consumes and produces constraints on a resource method handler, getting a reference will require them specified too. Example: var svc = rs . service (); svc . mapings () . resource ( \"\" ) . post () . consumes ([ 'application/json' , 'text/json' ]) . produces ([ 'application/json' ]) . serve ( function (){}); var handler = svc . mapings (). find ( \"\" , \"post\" , [ 'text/json' , 'application/json' ], [ 'application/json' ]); Note, that the order of the MIME type string values in the consumes/produces array parameters is not significant. They will be sorted before matching the sorted corresponding arrays in the definition. Configuring resource with JS object Having defined a resource with path we have two options for configuring it. We can proceed using its fluent API or we can provision a configuration JS object as second argument to the resource method and have it done in one step. Considering the latter, we will be provisioning configuration for this resource only, so it should be an object with method definitions as root members. rs . service () . resource ( \"\" , { \"get\" : [{ \"serve\" : function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . println ( \"Hello there!\" ); } }] }). execute (); Refer to the next sections for comparison how to achieve the same, using fluent API and/or configuration objects on the lower levels. JS Configuration object schema In progress. Check back later. Schema: { pathString : { methodString : [{ \"consumes\" : [ \"types/subtype|*/subtype|type/*|*/*\" ] \"produces\" : [ \"types/subtype|*/subtype|type/*|*/*\" ] \"before\" : Function \"serve\" : Function \"catch\" : Function \"finally\" : Function }] } } pathString is a string that represents the resource path. There could be 0 or more such non-overlapping members. methodString is a string for the HTTP resource method. There could be 0 or more such non-overlapping members. The value of methodString is an array of 0 or more objects, each defining a request method processing that will be executed under unique conditions (constraints) that match the request. A component in the methodString array, can consist of constraints (consumes, produces) and request processing flow event handlers (before, serve, catch, finally) consumes value is an array of 0 or more strings, each a valid MIME type string formatted as types/subtype. Can be undefined. produces value is an array of 0 or more strings, each a valid MIME type string formatted as types/subtype. Can be undefined. before , serve , catch and finally values are functions. Except for the serve function, the rest can be undefined . Building a CRUD rest service The code snippet below shows a sample design for a REST API for simple CRUD file operations.

Resource vs Path vs Resource Path As per the REST terms, a resource is an abstraction or a server-side resource that can be a file, a dynamically generated content, or a procedure (although the last is considered heresy by purists). It's virtually anything hosted on a server that has an address and can be accessed with a standard HTTP method. It is often referred to as \"path\" or \"resource path\" due to its singular most notable identifying characteristic. But to be precise, \"path\" is only a property of the resource. As far as configuration is concerned, the resource defines the configuration scope for which we define method handlers and constraints, and is identifiable by its \"path\" property.","title":"Defining service resources"},{"location":"development/concepts/rest/#resource-paths-and-path-templates","text":"The sPath string parameter (mandatory) of the resource() method will serve as the resource URL.

They are simply aliases for the generic method method .

The answer is that serve() configures only one of the callback functions that are triggered during the request processing flow. And this shortcut is handy if it is only serve() that you are interested into configuring. Of course, nothing prevents you also from using the shortcut and still configure the other callback functions, unless you find it confusing. These are all valid options. Find out more about configuring request processing callback functions in the section dedicated to this. When the controller API was discussed, it was mentioned that there are shortcut factory methods that combine a couple operations to produce directly a method handler for a resource path. Example rs . service () . get ( \"\" , function ( ctx , request , response ) { response . print ( 'ok' ); }) . execute (); That would be equivalent to the following: rs . service () . resource ( \"\" ) . get ( function ( ctx , request , response ){ response . print ( 'ok' ); }) . execute (); These shortcut methods share the same names with those in Resource that are used for defining HTTP method handlers: get , post , put , delete and its alias remove , but differ in signature (first argument is a string for the resource path) and the return type (the HttpController instance, instead of ResourceMethod). They are useful as a compact mechanism if you intend to build something simple and simplistic, such as a single resource and one or few handler functions for it. You will not be able to go much further with this API so if you consider anything even slightly more sophisticated you should look into the fluent API of resource instead: rs.service().resource(\"\") .

It has a rich set of editors, viewers, wizards, DevOps productivity tools, and a new Web IDE for in-system application development. The Web IDE is a composition of perspectives, each consisting of the necessary tools to accomplish a certain goal. Three of the UI elements retain their positions in all perpectives: top-area toolbar for the menus, theme selection, and user control sidebar on the left with shortcuts to the perspectives status bar at the bottom, for notifications and other use by the tools The tools that constitute the perspectives are laid out in predefined regions of the work plot, but you can change their position using drag and drop. The perspectives are simply predefined configurations, hence you can open, move, or close different tools on the work plot of a perspective for your convenience. You can also be maximize, minimize, or even pop out any of the tools in a separate window. The tools are the smallest atomic parts in the Web IDE. They are referred to as views or editors, and each type is handled differently. Perspectives By default, the different views and editors are separated into a few perspectives: Workbench Git Database Repository Terminal Operations Documents Debugger Views Each perspective is comprised of different views. Learn more about them following the list below: Snapshot Debugger Roles Jobs Documents Git Preview Workspace SQL Extensions Terminal Variables Breakpoints Console Logs Data Structures Access Listeners Database Search Import Registry Repository Editors Monaco is the editor integrated into the Eclipse Dirigible Web IDE. Modelers There are some more sophisticated visual editors: BPMN Modeler Database Schema Modeler Entity Data Modeler Form Designer Layouts The Web IDE layout API delegates the layout management to the GoldenLayout framework. Layouts is a convenience bag of functions that significantly simplifies the work with layouts. It takes care of views registry setup, the work plot regions configuration, layout initialization, serialization, control on the layout manager, open view and open editor functions, global notifications, and others. The top-area toolbar is a composite that aggregates the drop-down menus, the theme selection, the user name, and sign-out control. It uses the corresponding UI microservices available in the ideUiCore module as Menu, User, and Theme. By convention, all UI components are built with Bootstrap 3.x CSS and the themes in the Web IDE are actually custom Bootstrap CSS. A UI microservice enables dynamic change of the CSS upon change of the theme automatically. It is available as Angular factory theme. The Angular service User provides the details for the user that are rendered by the Menu directive, such as the user name. The sidebar is Angular directive that takes care of rendering a standard sidebar in the framework template. It works with the perspectives.js service to populate the registered perspectives as shortcuts. The status bar is an Angular directive that renders a standard, fixed-position footer. The component is subscribed to listen to message types configured as value of the status-bar-topic attribute, or by default to status-message messages.","title":"IDE Overview"},{"location":"development/ide/#ide-overview","text":"","title":"IDE Overview"},{"location":"development/ide/#web-ide","text":"The Web-based integrated development environment (Web IDE) runs directly in a browser and, therefore, does not require additional downloads and installations.

Three of the UI elements retain their positions in all perpectives: top-area toolbar for the menus, theme selection, and user control sidebar on the left with shortcuts to the perspectives status bar at the bottom, for notifications and other use by the tools The tools that constitute the perspectives are laid out in predefined regions of the work plot, but you can change their position using drag and drop. The perspectives are simply predefined configurations, hence you can open, move, or close different tools on the work plot of a perspective for your convenience. You can also be maximize, minimize, or even pop out any of the tools in a separate window. The tools are the smallest atomic parts in the Web IDE. They are referred to as views or editors, and each type is handled differently.","title":"Web IDE"},{"location":"development/ide/#perspectives","text":"By default, the different views and editors are separated into a few perspectives: Workbench Git Database Repository Terminal Operations Documents Debugger","title":"Perspectives"},{"location":"development/ide/#views","text":"Each perspective is comprised of different views.

Layouts is a convenience bag of functions that significantly simplifies the work with layouts. It takes care of views registry setup, the work plot regions configuration, layout initialization, serialization, control on the layout manager, open view and open editor functions, global notifications, and others. The top-area toolbar is a composite that aggregates the drop-down menus, the theme selection, the user name, and sign-out control. It uses the corresponding UI microservices available in the ideUiCore module as Menu, User, and Theme. By convention, all UI components are built with Bootstrap 3.x CSS and the themes in the Web IDE are actually custom Bootstrap CSS. A UI microservice enables dynamic change of the CSS upon change of the theme automatically. It is available as Angular factory theme. The Angular service User provides the details for the user that are rendered by the Menu directive, such as the user name. The sidebar is Angular directive that takes care of rendering a standard sidebar in the framework template. It works with the perspectives.js service to populate the registered perspectives as shortcuts. The status bar is an Angular directive that renders a standard, fixed-position footer. The component is subscribed to listen to message types configured as value of the status-bar-topic attribute, or by default to status-message messages.","title":"Layouts"},{"location":"development/ide/about/","text":"About The About view contains system information about Dirigible's installation.

Concepts In-System Development In-System Development is a programming model used when you work directly on a live system. Avoid side-effects of a simulated (local) environment by working on a live system. Access live data via the same channel which will be used in production. All the dependencies and integrations are on place as they will be in production. Shortest development turn-around time. Short life-cycle management process. Vertical Scenarios & Horizontal Scaling Covering end-to-end scenarios including all the application layers from architecture perspective as well as all the development process phases from project management perspective. All or nothing \u2013 partial doesn't count. Equal runtime instances based on a single content package for simple and reliable management. Content-Centric & Centralized Repository All application artifacts are in a single repository. Operational repository vs SCM repository. During development process is used IO optimized repository. After the code is ready it is committed to SCM - version, inspection and support optimized repository. Simple life-cycle management and transport. Workspace, Public Registry separation based on the development life-cycle phases. Dynamic Languages Perfect match to Dynamic Applications - built for change. Can interpret (rather than compile) the execution of tasks. Existing smooth integration within the web servers. No restart required. Java is used for the core components of the platform, while JavaScript is for the application business logic (the glue code). Injected Services Available out-of-the-box for developers \u2013 request, response, datasource, http, CMIS storage, BPMN engine, wiki, indexer, user, etc. Standardized API for cloud developers. Different language's implementations are possible integrated via the extension point. Different provider's implementations can be exposed to developers on their cloud. Integration Services Why integration services are part of the core? Cloud applications usually are extensions to a packaged software (on-premise or on-demand). Re-use of 3-rd party services is very often in this context. Replication use-case - major scenario for on-premise to on-demand cross-platform applications.

Angular, Bootstrap & GoldenLayout Why moved from RAP to Angular, Bootstrap, GoldenLayout web frameworks? RAP is an Eclipse framework providing a rendering of the user interface for standard SWT/JFace widgets remotely e.g. in a browser. It brings for us: RAP is a mature framework and depends on a reliable API, but not so attractive for pure web developers (HTML, JavaScript, etc.). RAP is a stable framework with great support, but also it could be said for Angular 1.x and Bootstrap 3.x RAP rely on the standard modularization \u2013 OSGi, plugins, but comes with the complexity of Maven, Tycho, OSGi, Orbit, etc. integration. In RAP developers can write mostly in pure Java with all the benefits it brings by itself, but for web developers it turns out it is not a benefit, but a drawback. In RAP one can have a single sourcing components - reuse of existing functionality written as Eclipse plugins, which has never happen in the reality. RAP has possibility to integrate non-Java modules as well (pure client side HTML and JavaScript) via the browser component, but it is much more complex than pure web coding. JSON Models Why JSON for models? JSON is very simple data exchange format. We have chosen it for the standard format for all the models. Simple enough and human readable/writable. Support by mature frameworks for parsing/serializing. Quite popular and proved in web applications context. Flat Data Models Why flat data models? Proved by many business applications for years. Straight forward implementation on relational-database. Easy to be understood and used by the developers. Tools for it are also simple and easy to use. REST Why REST instead of server-side generation? We leverage the use of REST paradigm for the cloud applications created with the toolkit. There are quite enough reasons for these already well described in blogs related to Web 2.0. Clean separation of the data services from the user interface. Independent development of both including easy mocking. Possibility of reuse and/or composition of services in different user interfaces. Possibility of UI-less integration if needed. Better operations and support. Publish Why Publish? Developers can work safely on multiple workspaces. \"Publish\" transfers the artifacts to the central registry space for public use. One-Time-Generation Why one-time-generation? It is enough to boost productivity in some cases. MDA is also supported via Entity Data Modeler. No OSGi OSGi is the only real modularization framework for Java, but comes with much more complexity than needed for our case.

Avoid side-effects of a simulated (local) environment by working on a live system. Access live data via the same channel which will be used in production. All the dependencies and integrations are on place as they will be in production. Shortest development turn-around time. Short life-cycle management process. Vertical Scenarios & Horizontal Scaling Covering end-to-end scenarios including all the application layers from architecture perspective as well as all the development process phases from project management perspective. All or nothing \u2013 partial doesn't count. Equal runtime instances based on a single content package for simple and reliable management. Content-Centric & Centralized Repository All application artifacts are in a single repository. Operational repository vs SCM repository. During development process is used IO optimized repository. After the code is ready it is committed to SCM - version, inspection and support optimized repository. Simple life-cycle management and transport. Workspace, Public Registry separation based on the development life-cycle phases. Dynamic Languages Perfect match to Dynamic Applications - built for change. Can interpret (rather than compile) the execution of tasks. Existing smooth integration within the web servers. No restart required. Java is used for the core components of the platform, while JavaScript is for the application business logic (the glue code). Injected Services Available out-of-the-box for developers \u2013 request, response, datasource, http, CMIS storage, BPMN engine, wiki, indexer, user, etc. Standardized API for cloud developers. Different language's implementations are possible integrated via the extension point. Different provider's implementations can be exposed to developers on their cloud. Integration Services Why integration services are part of the core? Cloud applications usually are extensions to a packaged software (on-premise or on-demand). Re-use of 3-rd party services is very often in this context. Replication use-case - major scenario for on-premise to on-demand cross-platform applications. Scheduled jobs as asynchronous activities usually needed. Semantic separation of integration and orchestration services from the other general purpose services.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS \"Contribution\" means: a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. \"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. \"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b) its license agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form: a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America.

Scaling The Eclipse Dirigible Deployment could be scaled horizontally by adding/removing Pods as follows: Scale to Zero Scale Up kubectl scale deployment/dirigible --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment/dirigible --replicas=<number-of-replicas> Note To learn more about application scaling in Kubernetes, see Horizontal Pod Autoscaling . Debugging To debug the Eclipse Dirigible engine via Remote Java Debugging execute the following commands: Scale the deployment to zero: kubectl scale deployment/dirigible --replicas=0 Set debug environment variables: kubectl set env deployment/dirigible -e JPDA_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8000 kubectl set env deployment/dirigible -e JPDA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket Edit the deployment and add command and args : kubectl edit deployment dirigible containers : - name : dirigible image : dirigiblelabs/dirigible:latest imagePullPolicy : Always command : [ \"/bin/sh\" ] args : [ \"/usr/local/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh\" , \"jpda\" , \"run\" ] Scale up the deployment: kubectl scale deployment/dirigible --replicas=1 Forward the debug port: kubectl port-forward deployment/dirigible 8000:8000 Clean-up To clean-up the environment after the debugging is done: Stop the port forwarding. Scale the deployment to zero.

Business Process Synchronization Usually when the *.bpmn process is saved it would take between one and two minutes to be deployed and active. After that period of time the business process can be executed. The synchronization period by default is set to 50 seconds ( 0/50 * * * * ? ) . Find out more about the Job Expression environment variables. Updating the *.bpmn file would result in new synchronization being triggered and the updated process flow would be available after minute or two. Updating the JavaScript Task Handler won't require new synchronization and the new behaviour of the handlers will be available on the fly. Create Process API To trigger and continue the BPMN Process execution a server-side JavaScript API will be created. Right click on the sample-bpm project and select New \u2192 Folder .

Business Process Synchronization Usually when the *.bpmn process is saved it would take between one and two minutes to be deployed and active.

Find out more about the Job Expression environment variables. Updating the *.bpmn file would result in new synchronization being triggered and the updated process flow would be available after minute or two.
